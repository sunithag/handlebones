TVs that feature higher resolution have more, and therefore finer (smaller) pixels that create a sharper, more detailed picture. TV resolutions are described by a number (such as 720 or 1080) followed by the letter \"i\" or \"p.\" The number describes how many horizontal rows of pixels the TV has, while the letter describes how those rows are drawn, or \"scanned\" -- either \"interlaced\" or \"progressive.\" Traditional \"interlaced scan\" TVs draw all the odd rows, then all the even rows alternately. Newer \"progressive scan\" TVs draw all the rows in sequence. This type of scanning generally allows for a sharper image with a higher vertical resolution. The highest resolution that is currently available in consumer televisions is 1080p, which is commonly referred to as <i>full-HD</i> resolution.","shelfDescription":"<li>46\" diagonal screen size<li>HDMI inputs: 4<li>Wall mountable with detachable base stand<li>Component, VGA and AV inputs","mfgNo":null,"modelNum":null,"dimensionX":-9.223372036854776E18,"dimensionY":-9.223372036854776E18,"dimensionZ":-9.223372036854776E18,"platform":null,"supplierWarranty":null,"warrantyLength":null,"assembledCountryOfOrigin":null,"componentsCountryOfOrigin":null,"accessoriesIncluded":null,"accessoriesNotIncluded":null,"ageRange":null,"gender":null,"rating":null,"attributeValue1":null,"attributeValue2":null,"attributeValue3":null,"attributeName1":null,"attributeName2":null,"attributeName3":null,"brandName":null,"manufacturerName":null,"alternateViews":null,"imageId":-9223372036854775808,"addlWarnMsgA":null,"addlWarnMsgB":null,"altWarnMsg":"N","panZoomId":2,"hasMatureContent":false,"attributeType1":null,"attributeUISetting1":null,"attributeRanking1":1,"attributeType2":null,"attributeUISetting2":null,"attributeRanking2":1,"attributeType3":null,"attributeUISetting3":null,"attributeRanking3":1,"attribute1_order":3,"attribute2_order":3,"attribute3_order":3,"partnerId":-1,"originalBaseUPC":"1113007391370","variantAttrData":null,"logoImage":"http://i.walmartimages.com/i/icon/-9/22/33/72/03/-9223372036854775808_100X60.gif","attributeData":[]},"alternateImageData":[],"id":20701140,"comparable":false,"upc":"1113007391370","customerRatingUrl":null,"partnerId":-1,"itemAttributes":[],"sellers":{"0":{"itemId":20701140,"sellerId":0,"sellerTypeId":1,"sellerName":"Walmart.com","currentItemPrice":609.98,"vendorItemNum":null,"weight":87.843,"wrapCode":0,"maximumItems":5,"baseItemPrice":599.0,"stockWaterMark":0,"displayStatus":3,"tagCode":0,"baseSuggPrice":799.99,"packingSlipCode":0,"minPrice":609.98,"maxPrice":609.98,"priceChangeCode":5,"productTaxCode":null,"rebateAmount":-9.223372036854776E18,"rebateTargetURL":null,"shippingDimX":33.03,"shippingDimY":56.49,"shippingDimZ":50.5,"s2SE":false,"sellerItemFlags":null,"freeReturns":false,"shipAlone":false,"remapToItemId":-9223372036854775808,"remapAction":null,"promotionDiscount":-9.223372036854776E18,"promotionMessageType":"","minPromotionAmount":-9.223372036854776E18,"maxPromotionAmount":-9.223372036854776E18,"fedExEligible":false,"smallFormatEligible":false,"thresholdShippingEligible":false,"isS2SOnly":false,"tweTaxCode":null,"shippingTaxCode":"2038346","giftWrapTaxCode":"2038857","ppu":-9.223372036854776E18,"fromPPU":-9.223372036854776E18,"contributesToThreshold":false,"isPIPEligible":"Y","checksum":-1,"freeShipping":false,"itemEligibleForFedEx":false,"is97CentShipping":false,"hasRebateLink":false,"storePickupable":true,"submapCode":0,"97CentShipping":false,"shippingDimensionX":33.03,"shippingDimensionY":56.49,"shippingDimensionZ":50.5,"employeeDiscountable":true,"combinedThresholdEligible":false,"availableShippingOfferCodes":null,"isFreeShipping":false}},"ppueligible":false,"uom":null,"unitCount":"0","itemFlags":null,"originalBaseUpc":"1113007391370","imageThumbnailURL":"http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/11/13/00/73/91/1113007391370_60X60.gif","electronicDelivery":false,"productImageUrl":"http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/11/13/00/73/91/1113007391370_215X215.jpg","hazardMaterial":false,"media":false,"specialPricing":null,"rebate":false,"putEligible":false,"imagePostCardURL":"http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/11/13/00/73/91/1113007391370_150X150.jpg"}]
