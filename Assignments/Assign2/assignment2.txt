Assignment 2
- Create a "product" webpage

Overview
========
The file "product.png" contains a mock-up for a proposed product page. Your assignment for Week 2 is to implement a working webpage version of this design.



Details
=======
- Focus on technologies that were hard for you in the first week.

- For this week stay with the same framework you used in assignment1 

- reuse the header and footer from Assignment1 to complete this assignment 
update the header to use canvas to build the Walmart logo

- Use the mockup and change the width of the page as if you are planning to build without a panel(as panel is extra credit) 

- Code should be checked in with the correct directory structure (views should be the views folder etc)  and use the right format for the JSON file .

- As with all assignments, you need to ensure the implementation adheres closely to the mock-up in a wide variety of browsers. For this assignment, consider IE 9+, Firefox 18+, and Chrome 25+ as browsers you must support.

- Don't take short-cuts on the page implementation; implement the page as you think a real production webpage should be structured.

- Demonstrate your best efforts to use front-end optimization best practices.
 
- use web storage to store product info that would be redundant to load if a user views multiple product pages

- None of the text should be implemented using bitmaps; real type should be used. Be thoughtful about choosing fonts that best represent the aesthetic of the design; consider using web fonts if appropriate.

- create a "product.json" which has all the details for a product ,use the same search query to pull all the data needed for it. 

- setup a server and change your code to load the "product.json" remotely (i.e., it may take several seconds to load). This means the page should not block on loading the file and should display some indication to the user that it is loading data.

- Use Css to build buttons on the page.

- For an extra challenge, include the panel from the mockup and when a tv is selected on the panel update the product page to reflect that new product on the page

- Feel free to use third-party libraries for whatever functionality you wish, but be sensitive to overall page size.

- Should be able to demo the use  these technologies on the page
- Should use canvas to implement graphics on the page
- web storage
- CSS grid
